# For this Challenge, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder
# customer in order to do the following:

# * Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase
# (which you created earlier in the module).

# * Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account
# address.

# * Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas
# estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

# * Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send
# this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

# * Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

# Once you receive the transaction’s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions
# section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that 
# you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the 
# README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.

# Step 1:
# Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application

# In this section, you'll import several functions from the `crypto_wallet.py`
# script into the file `fintech_finder.py`, which contains code for Fintech
# Finder’s customer interface, in order to add wallet operations to the
# application. For this section, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech
# Finder customer (i.e., you’ll provide your Ethereum wallet and account
# information to the application).

# Complete the following steps:

# 1. Review the code contained in the `crypto_wallet.py` script file. Note that
# the Ethereum transaction functions that you have built throughout this
# module-including `wallet`, `wallet.derive_acount`, `get_balance`, `fromWei`,
# `estimateGas`, `sendRawTransaction`, and others&mdash;have now been
# incorporated into Python functions that allow you to automate the process of
# accessing them.

# 2. Add your mnemonic seed phrase (provided by Ganache) to the starter code’s `SAMPLE.env` file.
# When the information has been added, rename the file `.env`.

# 3. Import the following functions from the `crypto_wallet.py` file:
# * `generate_account`
# * `get_balance`
# * `send_transaction`

# 4. Within the Streamlit sidebar section of code, create a variable named
# `account`. Set this variable equal to a call on the `generate_account`
# function. This function will create the Fintech Finder customer’s (in this
# case, your) HD wallet and Ethereum account.

# 5. Within this same section of the `fintech_finder.py` file, define a
# new `st.sidebar.write` function that will display the balance of the
# customer’s account. Inside this function, call the `get_balance` function
# and pass it your Ethereum `account.address`.

# Step 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction

# Complete the following steps:

# 1. Fintech Finder customers will select a fintech professional from the
# application interface’s drop-down menu, and then input the amount of time for
# which they’ll hire the worker. Code the application so that once a customer
# completes these steps, the application will calculate the amount that the
# worker will be paid in ether. To do so, complete the following steps:

    # * Write the equation that calculates the candidate’s wage. This equation
    #  should assess the candidate’s hourly rate from the candidate database
    # (`candidate_database[person][3]`) and then multiply this hourly rate by
    # the value of the `hours` variable. Save this calculation’s output as a
    # variable named `wage`.

    # * Write the `wage` variable to the Streamlit sidebar by
    # using `st.sidebar.write`.

# 2. Now that the application can calculate a candidate’s wage, write the code
# that will allow a customer (you, in this case) to send an Ethereum blockchain
# transaction that pays the hired candidate. To accomplish this, locate the
# code that reads `if st.sidebar.button("Send Transaction")`. You’ll need to
# add logic to this `if` statement that sends the appropriate information to
# the `send_transaction` function (which you imported from the `crypto_wallet`
# script file). Inside the `if` statement, add the following functionality:

    # * Call the `send_transaction()` function and pass it three parameters:
        # - Your Ethereum `account` information. (Remember that this `account`
        # instance was created when the `generate_account` function was called.)
        #  From the `account` instance, the application will be able to access the
        #  `account.address` information that is needed to populate the `from` data
        # attribute in the raw transaction.
        #- The `candidate_address` (which will be created and identified in the
        # sidebar when a customer selects a candidate). This will populate the `to`
        # data attribute in the raw transaction.
        # - The `wage` value. This will be passed to the `toWei` function to
        # determine the wei value of the payment in the raw transaction.

    # * Save the transaction hash that the `send_transaction` function returns
    # as a variable named `transaction_hash`, and have it display on the
    # application’s web interface.

##########################################
# Step 2 - Part 1:
# * Write the equation that calculates the candidate’s wage. This equation
# should assess the candidate’s hourly rate from the candidate database
# (`candidate_database[person][3]`) and then multiply this hourly rate by
# the value of the `hours` variable. Save this calculation’s output as a
# variable named `wage`.
# * Write the `wage` variable to the Streamlit sidebar by using `st.sidebar.write`.

# @TODO
# Calculate total `wage` for the candidate by multiplying the candidate’s hourly
# rate from the candidate database (`candidate_database[person][3]`) by the
# value of the `hours` variable

# Write the `wage` calculation to the Streamlit sidebar

##########################################
# Step 2 - Part 2:
# * Call the `send_transaction` function and pass it three parameters:
    # - Your Ethereum `account` information. (Remember that this `account`
    # instance was created when the `generate_account` function was called.)
    #  From the `account` instance, the application will be able to access the
    #  `account.address` information that is needed to populate the `from` data
    # attribute in the raw transaction.
    #- The `candidate_address` (which will be created and identified in the
    # sidebar when a customer selects a candidate). This will populate the `to`
    # data attribute in the raw transaction.
    # - The `wage` value. This will be passed to the `toWei` function to
    # determine the wei value of the payment in the raw transaction.

# * Save the transaction hash that the `send_transaction` function returns as a
# variable named `transaction_hash`, and have it display on the application’s
# web interface.


if st.sidebar.button("Send Transaction"):

    # @TODO
    # Call the `send_transaction` function and pass it 3 parameters:
    # Your `account`, the `candidate_address`, and the `wage` as parameters

################################################################################
# Step 3: Inspect the Transaction

# Send a test transaction by using the application’s web interface, and then
# look up the resulting transaction hash in Ganache.

# Complete the following steps:

# 1. From your terminal, navigate to the project folder that contains
# your `.env` file and the `fintech_finder.py` and `crypto_wallet.py` files.
# Be sure to activate your Conda `dev` environment if it is not already active.

# 2. To launch the Streamlit application,
# type `streamlit run fintech_finder.py`.

# 3. On the resulting webpage, select a candidate that you would like to hire
# from the appropriate drop-down menu. Then, enter the number of hours that you
# would like to hire them for. (Remember, you do not have a lot of ether in
# your account, so you cannot hire them for long!)

# 4 Click the Send Transaction button to sign and send the transaction with
# your Ethereum account information. If the transaction is successfully
# communicated to Ganache, validated, and added to a block,
# a resulting transaction hash code will be written to the Streamlit
# application sidebar.
    
# 5. Navigate to the Ganache accounts tab and locate your account (index 0).
    # * Take a screenshot of the address, balance, and transaction (TX) count.
    # Save this screenshot to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for
    #  this Challenge assignment.
    
# 6. Navigate to the Ganache transactions tab and locate the transaction.
    # * Click the transaction and take a screenshot of it.
    # Save this screenshot to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for
    #  this Challenge assignment.
